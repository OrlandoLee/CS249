/* =====================
 *  COMMENT FOR AUTHORS
 * =====================
 * How to run your algorithm:
 * In the main method, you can easily test your algorithm by the following two steps.
 * 
 * First, make an instance of your recommender with a constructor you implemented.
 *  Ex) CustomRecommender myRecommender = new CustomRecommender(2000, 1000, 5.0, 1.0);
 * 
 * Second, call "testRecommender" method in main method.
 * This returns a String which contains evaluation results.
 * The first argument is the name to be printed, and the second one is the instance you created previously.
 *  Ex) System.out.println(testRecommender("MyRec", myRecommender));
 * 
 * 
 * We provide a unit test module to help you verifying whether your implementation is correct.
 * In the main method, you can make an instance of unit test module with your recommender by
 *  Ex) UnitTest u = new UnitTest(myRecommender, rateMatrix, testMatrix);
 * 
 * After you make the instance, simply call "check" method by
 *  Ex) u.check();
 * 
 * The unit test module may print some warnings or errors based on verification result.
 * If you get some errors, they should be fixed since they imply your implementation is illegal or incorrect.
 * If you get some warnings, you may concern them and we recommend to investigate your code.
 * If the unit test module does not find any problem, it will say so.
 * We recommend to rerun with various parameters since some problems may occur occasionally.
